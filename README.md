## Grafana dashboards

** NOTE: As of version 2.10+ of Cinnamon dashboards are no longer published to this repository. Instead, you can [download the dashboards here](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/cinnamon/current/visualizations/grafana.html#download-dashboards). **

Select the dashboard for the version of Cinnamon that you're using, as well as the datasource. Note that Grafana dashboards are specific to a datasource.

There are Grafana dashboards for the following, when available for a particular Cinnamon version and Grafana datasource:

* Actor Metrics
* Actor Events
* Trace Spans
* Dispatcher Metrics
* JVM Metrics
* Lagom Circuit Breakers

For more information on how to install and use these dashboards please visit the [Cinnamon documentation](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/cinnamon/latest/home.html).
